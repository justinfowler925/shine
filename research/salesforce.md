# salesforce.md

Verified 2026-08-04 against live docs and by inspecting the shipping npm artifacts.

**Verdict up front: a constrained palette target, not a design target.** Budget for "our brand colors on Salesforce's design system," not "our design system on Salesforce." That's achievable, durable, officially supported, and roughly a day of emitter work.

---

## Status

**SLDS 2** is the design system. **Cosmos** is the first *theme* built on it — the two are not synonyms and are often conflated.

| Release | Event |
|---|---|
| Winter '25 | Beta, as "Enhanced Lightning User Interface" |
| Spring '25 | Renamed SLDS 2 (beta). `lightningdesignsystem.com` now serves SLDS 2; SLDS 1 moved to `v1.lightningdesignsystem.com` |
| **Winter '26** | **GA, all editions** |
| Summer '26 (current) | Dark mode broadened; Themes and Branding UI expanded to typography, shadows, sizing, spacing |
| Winter '27 | Group-based SLDS 2 activation *(roadmap preview, non-binding)* |

**SLDS 1 is not deprecated and has no announced retirement date.** SLDS 2 is default for **new orgs only**; existing orgs opt in via Themes and Branding.

**No SLDS 2 support planned** for: Salesforce mobile app, Flow Builder, Lightning App Builder, Lightning Out, **Experience Cloud**.

**What *is* formally deprecated: SLDS 1 design tokens (`--lwc-*`).** The doc page title literally carries "(Deprecated)" — they still work in SLDS 1 themes but are **not included in SLDS 2 themes**.

npm ships both in parallel — `@salesforce-ux/design-system` dist-tags: `summer-26: 2.30.4`, `winter-27: 2.264.0-beta.3`.

## The token architecture

`--sds-*` is dead legacy. Live namespace is `--slds-` with a **tier letter** as the second segment. Counts extracted from `@salesforce-ux/design-tokens@4.0.0`:

| Tier | Prefix | Count | Status for us |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **Reference** | `--slds-r-*` | **85** | **The only sanctioned override surface** |
| Global | `--slds-g-*` | 524 | Consume only — **overriding is explicitly prohibited** |
| Shared | `--slds-s-*` | 107 | Classified **private**, prohibited |
| Component | `--slds-c-*` | — | Officially unsupported in SLDS 2 |
| Private | `--_slds-*` | — | Prohibited |

Cosmos theme total: **717 tokens** (524 global + 107 shared + 85 reference + 1 config flag), 42 flagged deprecated.

The chain resolves `r → g → s → c`:

```css
--slds-g-color-accent-1: var(--slds-r-color-brand-50);
--slds-g-color-accent-2: light-dark(var(--slds-r-color-brand-40), var(--slds-r-color-brand-70));
```

**This is the leverage point.** Because of that chain, overriding **17 `--slds-r-color-brand-*` steps recolors the entire accent system across every component.** The emitter's whole job for Salesforce is mapping a brand ramp onto ~85 reference tokens.

The prohibition, verbatim from *New Global Styling Hooks Guidance*:

> "We don't support overriding the values of global styling hooks in your customizations."
> "Re-assigning a new value to a global styling hook inside your component is prohibited. You will be subject to test failures and future breaking changes."

⚠️ Note a genuine contradiction: the token package README documents `--slds-s-*` as a normal public scope, while the guidance page classifies it as private and prohibits consumption. The package emits them; the guidance forbids using them. **Treat the guidance as controlling.**

---

## The token contract is first-class — better than most design systems ship

`@salesforce-ux/design-tokens@4.0.0` (2026-06-01) ships per theme:

- `*.global.tokens.raw.json` — DTCG-faithful (`$value`, `$type`, `$description`, `$extensions`)
- `*.global.tokens.flat.json` — **717 entries, consumer-oriented**
- `*.{global,reference,shared}.tokens.css`
- iOS Swift + Android Kotlin outputs
- `*.deprecated.tokens.raw.json`

Every flat entry carries `name`, `value`, `originalValue`, `type`, `syntax`, `category`, `scope`, `namespace`, `description`, `inherits`, `themeOwned`, `darkValue`, `deprecated`, and **`cssProperties`** — the allowlist of CSS properties the hook is legal on. 628 of 717 are `themeOwned`; 287 carry a distinct `darkValue`.

Built with Style Dictionary v5, with a dedicated `validate:dtcg` compliance check. Dark mode lives in `$extensions["com.salesforce-ux.mode"].dark`.

**OKLCH is authoring-only.** README: *"Palette aliases defined in OKLCH perceptual color space, converted to hex for compatibility."* Grepping the shipped CSS: **zero** `oklch()`, `color-mix()` or P3 — 506 hex literals. Do not hand SLDS an OKLCH value and expect it to work. It does use **`light-dark()`** heavily — 302 occurrences in the Cosmos global file.

**SLDS 2 decouples structure from style.** Confirmed in `@salesforce-ux/design-system-2@2.264.0`: `css/modular/slds2.base.css` (structure, no theme values) ships separately from `css/modular/slds2.theme.cosmos.css` (token values only), so themes swap by changing one `<link href>`.

---

## Override mechanics are unusually permissive

All token declarations sit in:

```css
@layer theme { :where(html) { /* … */ } }
```

`:where()` is zero-specificity **and** layered CSS loses to unlayered author CSS. So any custom property you set wins trivially — **no `!important`, no specificity fights.** That's a real gift and rare.

**Custom properties pierce shadow boundaries** — they're inherited properties, so synthetic vs native shadow doesn't matter here. Synthetic remains the LEX default; native is per-component opt-in via `shadowSupportMode = 'native'`, still Beta, no announced date for flipping the default.

---

## The blunt part: you cannot deliver the overrides

**There is no supported org-wide CSS injection point in internal Lightning Experience.**

- `loadStyle` from `lightning/platformResourceLoader` is **scoped to the calling component**.
- Experience Cloud has a real Custom CSS panel in Experience Builder. **Internal LEX has nothing equivalent.**
- Appending `<style>` to `document.head` from an LWC is undocumented, unsupported, and will break.
- The only sanctioned global path is **Themes and Branding — a human clicking in Setup.**

So the realistic Salesforce output of a token system is **not a stylesheet**. It's:

1. A **brand palette spec** an admin transcribes into Themes and Branding, and
2. **Per-component CSS** for LWCs you own.

If the architecture assumes "emit a file, load it, done," Salesforce breaks that assumption. This is the same tier as the email target — constrained by the renderer, not by the design.

LWC CSS limits: `:host` works; ID selectors, `:host-context()` and `::part` are unsupported; you cannot style a child component's internals — custom properties are the documented cross-boundary mechanism.

---

## What you can and cannot control

**Can:** brand color ramps · typography, spacing, sizing, shadows, radius and illustration color via Summer '26 Themes and Branding · light/dark pairs free through `light-dark()` · full CSS inside LWCs you author.

**Cannot:** layout · spacing rhythm · component structure · iconography · border treatments · the Cosmos circular-motif visual language · anything in Flow Builder, App Builder, mobile or Experience Cloud · any managed-package component.

---

## Tooling

**SLDS Linter** — `@salesforce-ux/slds-linter@1.2.1` (2026-03-05). Plain npm CLI, ESLint-based (migrated off Stylelint), SARIF or CSV output, and integrated into Salesforce Code Analyzer. **Runs headless in CI.**

```bash
npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint
npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint --fix
npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest report
```

Relevant rules: `no-hardcoded-values-slds2`, `no-slds-var-without-fallback`, `lwc-token-to-slds-hook`, `no-unsupported-hooks-slds2`, `enforce-component-hook-naming-convention`, `no-slds-private-var`, `no-deprecated-classes-slds2`.

**`--fix` is a genuine codemod.** It rewrites `--lwc-*` → `--slds-g-*` keeping the old value as a CSS fallback, wraps hardcoded values as `var(--slds-g-*, <original>)`, fixes BEM syntax, and renames malformed hooks.

⚠️ **But for `no-unsupported-hooks-slds2` the "fix" is deletion** — unsupported `--slds-c-*` hooks are removed, because there is nothing to remap them to. Read the diff before accepting it.

The **SLDS Validator** VS Code extension (v2.0.8) is a separate thing; its SLDS2 rules are beta and off by default.

There is **no product called "SLDS Migration Assistant."** It doesn't exist.

## Component hooks: docs are lagging the code

Official line, unchanged since Spring '25: *"Component styling hooks aren't currently supported in SLDS 2… we recommend that you keep your org on SLDS 1 themes for now."* No committed date.

**But the shipping artifact says otherwise.** The `@salesforce-ux/design-system-2` changelog shows active per-component re-opening through 2026 — *"open component hook API on accordion,"* *"open hook API on trees,"* *"open color hook API on tile"* — plus a new Storybook Component Hooks addon and a HookAPI doc block.

Measured in the shipped CSS: of **275 unique `--slds-c-*` names referenced, 90 are now declared**, and **35 of 89 components** have a migrated `themes/cosmos.css` layer. The blanket "not supported" is stale, but there's no roadmap commitment to cite.

## Audit the target org before scoping anything

Every org is different, and the inventory decides the plan. Run it first — it is
20 minutes of grep against the metadata repo, and it changes the answer:

| Count | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| LWC components, and how many carry CSS | The real surface area |
| Hex + `rgb()` literals | The migration bill, and the argument for tokens |
| `px`/`rem` literals | Spacing is usually ~100% hardcoded — confirm before promising a scale |
| Hand-authored styling hooks, by tier | `--slds-c-*` is unsupported in SLDS 2; `slds-linter --fix` will **delete** them |
| Global `--slds-g-*` hooks | Overriding these is explicitly prohibited — any count above zero is a finding |
| `loadStyle` usage | The only component-scoped CSS path; none means nothing is themed today |
| Private variable namespaces | Competing conventions for one concept are the real defect, not the count |
| Vendored SLDS static resources | Read the version numbering — a `2.0.x` resource is SLDS **1** |
| Nested projects with their own `sfdx-project.json` | Live or abandoned changes the scope materially |

Two failure shapes worth naming, because both are common and neither surfaces in
a token audit: **a design system delivered through an iframe** — a static-resource
stylesheet an LWC points an iframe at, whose tokens reach nothing outside the
frame — and **an SLDS styling hook fed a hardcoded brand hex**, which is the whole
problem in one line.

---

## The plan for any target

1. **Emit a brand-palette spec**, not a stylesheet — the ~17 `--slds-r-color-brand-*` steps plus the Themes-and-Branding-settable values, as a document an admin transcribes once.
2. **Emit per-component CSS** for LWCs you own, using `var(--slds-g-x, var(--lwc-y, literal))` so it degrades cleanly on SLDS 1 orgs.
3. **Wire `slds-linter` into CI** with SARIF output. This is free, official, and immediately useful regardless of anything else here.
4. **Do not migrate the literals as a project.** Fix them opportunistically as components are touched, starting with hardcoded brand hexes — those are pure duplication of tokens that already exist.
5. **Consume `flat.json` as the authority** for what tokens exist. Do not hand-maintain a mapping table.
