# Salesforce mobile (no datatable)

Regions. Host: Salesforce mobile app / native webview. Paint: the host's SLDS 2 styling hooks (see `salesforce.md`). Cite `lex-mobile`.

1. **Top bar** — title + one action. Back is the platform back, not a custom chevron that fights the OS.
2. **Focal** — one object. A record is highlights then detail, stacked. A queue is a list, not a table.
3. **Actions** — a sticky action bar or the platform action sheet. Not hover. Not a 7-column datatable.

## Rules

- `lightning-datatable` is not supported here. Lists, not tables.
- Touch targets ≥ 44px.
- Do not cite `lex-queue` and ship a desktop table into the mobile host.

## Checklist (agent)

- Name the host before citing (LEX / console / LWR / email / mobile).
- Structure comes from this file; paint comes from the host's SLDS 2 styling hooks (see `salesforce.md`) except LWR and email.
- Prove in the browser: render, screenshot, and walk the primary workflow.
- Do not substitute a shadcn dashboard or an Ant profile because it scored on the word "record".
- Empty, loading, and error states are real regions, not afterthoughts.
- One primary action. Row actions are visible without hover.
- Read `references/salesforce.md` for org-measured hook names before writing a token.

## Source of truth

- Regions above are the structure. They are not optional.
- `references/salesforce.md` has the org-measured SLDS 2 hook names.
- A pack shot (when harvested) is the pixel reference; this file is the region map.
- If compare cannot run because there is no shot, say so — do not invent a likeness score.
- Host mismatch is a defect (record vs LWR vs email vs mobile).

## Regions recap

- One focal object.
- One primary action.
- States (empty, loading, error) are first-class, not overlays you remember later.
- Paint from the voice sheet for this family; do not invent a parallel palette.

## Fail closed

- No shot in the pack: say there is no shot. Do not describe pixels you did not see.
- No SLDS hook resolving in the org: that is a literal. Measure `getComputedStyle`.
- A table on mobile or LWR is the wrong host.
- A second filled primary is a defect.
